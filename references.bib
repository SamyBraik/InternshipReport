    abstract = {Velocity field statistics in the inertial to dissipation range of three-dimensional homogeneous steady turbulent flow are studied using a high-resolution DNS with up to N=10243 grid points. The range of the Taylor microscale Reynolds number is between 38 and 460. Isotropy at the small scales of motion is well satisfied from half the integral scale (L) down to the Kolmogorov scale (η). The Kolmogorov constant is 1.64±0.04, which is close to experimentally determined values. The third order moment of the longitudinal velocity difference scales as the separation distance r, and its coefficient is close to 4/5. A clear inertial range is observed for moments of the velocity difference up to the tenth order, between 2λ≈100η and L/2≈300η, where λ is the Taylor microscale. The scaling exponents are measured directly from the structure functions; the transverse scaling exponents are smaller than the longitudinal exponents when the order is greater than four. The crossover length of the longitudinal velocity structure function increases with the order and approaches 2λ, while that of the transverse function remains approximately constant at λ. The crossover length and importance of the Taylor microscale are discussed.},

abstract = {The present theoretical and experimental knowledge of the intense intermittent events in high Reynolds number turbulence is reviewed. An attempt is made to relate the two main streams of research in this area: the multifractal description and the coherent filaments identified in numerical simulations. It is concluded that, although both approaches can be expressed in a common language, they are inconsistent in detail and both are incomplete. While the multifractal approach is a kinematic description without dynamics, the present understanding of the scaling and dynamics of the coherent vortices requires the existence of stable laminar structures of arbitrarily large Reynolds numbers, and probably represents only one of a hierarchy of intermittent objects. It is suggested that the vortices may not survive at very high values of Reλ, and that the problem extends to all the intermittent structures of turbulence. It is shown that the filaments should dominate the structure functions in a range of scales that goes from beyond the Kolmogorov scale for p < 4 to the whole inertial range if the scaling exponent ζp → ∞ (usually expected as p → ∞.)}
